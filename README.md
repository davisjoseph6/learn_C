# How to write:

Below is the process and steps I need to follow for writing programs: 
1. Start by thinking about the question before writing code: determine what is expected, the conditions, etc. (software requirements and software design). 
2. Before writing the entire code, look for answers in the software documentation, technical communication, and manual pages, if they are accessible and available. 
3. Whiteboard (abstraction), software architecture, data modeling, write pseudocode (design pattern), then boilerplate code (if necessary). 
4. Start coding. However, before targeting all requirements, first make sure you get the expected output on the terminal. 
5. Test regularly, not only for standard cases, but also for special cases (edge cases). 
6. Try to satisfy the other conditions. Also keep in mind the principle of separation of concerns (modular programming). 
7. Write unit tests whenever possible. 
8. Restructure (refactor) your code. 
9. The, optimize it to make it more efficient, run faster, and use less space or memory (time and space complexity). 
10. Once this is done, you can continue by fulfilling the other requirements, such as coding style, comments, best practices, etc
